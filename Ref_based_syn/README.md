#RL-De-Novo-TYR-Inhibitor-Generation-Based-on-Lead-Compound


## RL model-driven forward structural optimization of the AI-generated TYR inhibitor AI10
Using compound AI10 as the reference molecule, an RL-driven molecular generation strategy to autonomously design target compounds were employed. Specifically, a fragment-based growth and expansion approach was applied, in which the reference molecule was decomposed into multiple query fragments. These fragments were then used to assemble sets of structurally related fragments, from which new molecules were generated by predefined reaction templates. The resulting candidates were evaluated by structural similarity and docking against the reference scaffold, enabling the algorithm to yield compounds with comparable architectures and physicochemical properties. By integrating predicted activity, drug-likeness, synthetic feasibility, and structural similarity to the lead compound AI10, 32 candidate molecules (AI10-a1 to AI10-a32) were prioritized for laboratory synthesis.
