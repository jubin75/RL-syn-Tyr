the framework based on reinforcement learning for forward synthesis


## AI-driven de novo molecular generation targeting TYR
This study proposes an innovative framework that integrates de novo molecular design with synthetic feasibility evaluation, leveraging RL-driven forward synthesis planning to significantly improve both the generation efficiency and synthetic success rate of target molecules. Initially, 200 high-affinity fragments were selected from a building block database based on molecular docking results to form the starting pool. In subsequent iterations, a diversity-constrained mechanism was introduced-fragments were selected based on structural fingerprint clustering and synthesis complexity weighting to ensure both novelty and coverage. During the molecule generation phase, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was used to guide synthetic pathway exploration. The novelty of this framework lies in three key aspects: Bidirectional optimization: Simultaneous optimization of molecular bioactivity and synthetic accessibility; Adaptive exploration: Dynamic reward shaping based on fragment usage frequency to suppress repetitive generation of redundant structures.
