# RL-syn-Tyr
Actively design small molecules targeting Tyrosinase and their synthetic pathways using reinforcement learning and molecular generation algorithms

#Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) de novo molecular generation is a highly promising strategy in the drug discovery, with deep reinforcement learning (RL) models emerging as powerful tools. This study introduces a fragment-by-fragment growth RL forward molecular generation and optimization strategy based on a low activity lead compound. This process integrates fragment growth-based reaction templates, while target docking and drug-likeness prediction were simultaneously performed. This comprehensive approach considers molecular similarity, internal diversity, synthesizability, and effectiveness, thereby enhancing the quality and efficiency of molecular generation. Finally, a series of tyrosinase inhibitors were generated and synthesized. Furthermore, metabolic stability studies indicated susceptibility to hepatic metabolism. The proposed AI structural optimization strategies will play a promising role in accelerating the drug discovery and improving traditional efficiency.
